# Node Chat App

This is a chat demo built on Node.js. It integrates a [Naive Bayes classifier](https://github.com/IkechukwuAKalu/node-naive-bayes) for blocking of spams. The Naive Bayes classifier and this chat app demo make up my final year project.

It does not use sessions or cookies to maintain state, and hence when the page is refreshed, all messages are cleared for that client.

Both the UI and code was made to be simple so as to show the classifier in action, which is the main aim of the project.
